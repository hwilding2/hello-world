My name is Haven Wilding. I came to college a couple days after turning 18. Two days later, I met Jonathan Wilding. Two months later, we decided to date. Two months later, we got engaged. Two months later we got married. Five months later we decided to try and get pregnant, but didn't for a while. A week before our first anniversary, the pregnancy test came up positive. Nine months later, our little girl, Harper Rose Wilding, joined our family. Two weeks later, I started my junior year and my husband started his senior year at BYU.
